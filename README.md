# Melody-Generation
An autonomous melody generation LSTM model.

Uses publicly available datasets at http://www.esac-data.org/ as input to train and generate an LSTM model stored in model.h5, which can be run using melody_generator. To get different melodies, change the seed in the melody_generator file.
